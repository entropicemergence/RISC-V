Info: Option to preserve fewer signal transitions to reduce memory requirements is enabled
    Info: Simulation has been partitioned into sub-simulations according to the maximum transition count determined by the engine. Transitions from memory will be flushed out to disk at the end of each sub-simulation to reduce memory requirements.
Info: Simulation partitioned into 1 sub-simulations
Info: Simulation coverage is     100.00 %
Info: Number of transitions in simulation is 830
